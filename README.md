# Google Foobar Challenge

Success! You've managed to infiltrate Commander Lambda's evil organization, and finally earned yourself an entry-level position as a Minion on their space station. From here, you just might be able to subvert Commander Lambda's plans to use the LAMBCHOP doomsday device to destroy Bunny Planet. Problem is, Minions are the lowest of the low in the Lambda hierarchy. Better buck up and get working, or you'll never make it to the top...

The Google foobar challenge introduces a series of thematic coding challenges with the goal of saving "Bunny Planet" from "Commander Lambda". Solutions can be provided in either Python or Java.

In this repository I present my experience in this challenge and my solutions for each problem.
